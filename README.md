# clnotes

## Description
clnotes is a command line tool that helps you keep track of your notes/todos using the command line, like a pro(grammer) B-). This is the first thing that I have ever built with C that actually does something helpful, so feedback is more than welcome.

## Installation
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/TomiG06/clnotes.git
cd clnotes
./setup.sh
```

## Commands
* `-c [new instance (string)]`
* `-r [status, . or blank(all)]`
* `-u [number/s to check/uncheck]`
* `-d [number/s to delete, .(all), status]`
* `-h`

## Notes

* Inside the program, words 'note', 'instance' and 'todo' refer to the same thing
